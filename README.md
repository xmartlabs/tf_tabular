# TF Tabular

### Feature Overview
* Create input layers based on lists of columns
* No model building or training: Build whatever you want on top
* Support custom embeddings
* Support attention for mixing sequence layers
* Support multi-hot categoricals
* Support computing vocab and normalization params?


### Competitor analysis
* DeepTables:
  * This is for TensorFlow
  * Broader scope: Includes model building and training
* Pytorch tabular:
  * Only Pytorch
  * Broader scope: Includes model building and training
  * Not focused on recommenders (no support for multi-hot and sequence columns https://github.com/manujosephv/pytorch_tabular/issues/174)


## Project Organization

- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions used for building, testing, and publishing.
- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Contains Dockerfile to build a development container for VSCode with all the necessary extensions for Python development installed.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Contains the configuration for the development container for VSCode, including the Docker image to use, any additional VSCode extensions to install, and whether or not to mount the project directory into the container.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: Contains VSCode settings specific to the project, such as the Python interpreter to use and the maximum line length for auto-formatting.
- `src`: Place new source code here.
- `tests`: Contains Python-based test cases to validate source code.
- `pyproject.toml`: Contains metadata about the project and configurations for additional tools used to format, lint, type-check, and analyze Python code.

### `pyproject.toml`

The pyproject.toml file is a centralized configuration file for modern Python projects. It streamlines the development process by managing project metadata, dependencies, and development tool configurations in a single, structured file. This approach ensures consistency and maintainability, simplifying project setup and enabling developers to focus on writing quality code. Key components include project metadata, required and optional dependencies, development tool configurations (e.g., linters, formatters, and test runners), and build system specifications.

In this particular pyproject.toml file, the [build-system] section specifies that the Flit package should be used to build the project. The [project] section provides metadata about the project, such as the name, description, authors, and classifiers. The [project.optional-dependencies] section lists optional dependencies, like pyspark, while the [project.urls] section supplies URLs for project documentation, source code, and issue tracking.

The file also contains various configuration sections for different tools, including bandit, black, coverage, flake8, pyright, pytest, tox, and pylint. These sections specify settings for each tool, such as the maximum line length for flake8 and the minimum code coverage percentage for coverage.


## TODO:
* Parse dataset to separate numeric vs categoricals, multihots and sequencials
